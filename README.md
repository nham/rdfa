Overview
--------

This is a class + helper functions for making interactive deterministic finite automatas with [raphael.js](http://raphaeljs.com). A user can manually step through the input string, which graphically advances the input tape and appropriately highlights the state of the machine as it changes. A user can also enter an input string to be stepped through by the machine.

Examples forthcoming.
